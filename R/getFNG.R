#' @description
#' The fear and greed index is a market sentiment indicator that measures investor emotions to
#' gauge whether they are generally fearful (indicating potential selling pressure) or greedy (indicating potential buying enthusiasm)
#'
#' @param from An optional vector of length 1. Can be [Sys.Date()]-class, [Sys.time()]-class or [as.character()] in %Y-%m-%d format.
#' @param to An optional vector of length 1. Can be [Sys.Date()]-class, [Sys.time()]-class or [as.character()] in %Y-%m-%d format.
