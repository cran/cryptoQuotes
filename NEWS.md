# cryptoQuotes 1.2.0

* All `from` and `to` arguments are now more flexible, and supports passing `Sys.Date()` and `Sys.time()` directly into the `get`-functions.

* `getQuote()` now returns up to 100 pips preceding the specified `to` date, when `from = NULL`. It returns 100 pips, or up to `Sys.Date()`, from the specified `from` date.

The `getQuote()`-function can now be used as follows;

```
## Specifying from
## date only;
##
## Returns 10 pips
getQuote(
 ticker   = 'BTCUSDT',
 interval = '1d'
 from     = as.character(Sys.Date() - 10)
 )
```

```
## Specifying to
## date only;
##
## Returns 100 pips
getQuote(
 ticker   = 'BTCUSDT',
 interval = '1d'
 to     = as.character(Sys.Date())
 )
```
